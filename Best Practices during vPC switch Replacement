Steps
Shut down all vPC member ports one by one.
Shut down all orphan ports.
Shut down all Layer 3 physical links one by one.
Shut down the vPC Peer Keep Alive (PKA) link.
Shut down the vPC Peer-link.
Ensure that all the ports are down on the problematic switch.
Ensure the traffic is diverted to the Redundant switch via shared commands on the redundant switch.

Ensure the replacement device is set up with the correct image and license.

Configure the switch with the backup configuration correctly.
If auto-recovery is enabled, disable it during replacement.

Leaf-2(config-vpc-domain)# no auto-recovery

Legend: 
(*) - local vPC is down, forwarding via vPC peer-link 
vPC domain id : 1 
Peer status : peer adjacency formed ok

Ensure the Sticky bit is set to False.

Leaf-5(config-vpc-domain)# show sys internal vpcm info all | i i stick
OOB Peer Version: 2 OOB peer was alive: TRUE Sticky Master: FALSE
If the Sticky bit is set to True, reconfigure the vPC role priority. This means to reapply the original configuration for the role priority.
vPC domain 1     <==  1 is vPC domain number mentioned on the original switch
role priority 2000   <== example: if 2000 is vPC role priority set on original switch
Bring up the interfaces strictly in this order:
Bring up the Peer Keep-alive Link.
Bring up the vPC peer-link.
Confirm that the vPC role established correctly.
Bring up rest of the interfaces on the switches one by one in this order:
vPC member ports
Orphan ports (Non-vPC ports)
Layer-3 physical interface
