The vPC domain includes both vPC peer devices
  enable the vPC feature before you can configure or run the vPC functionality.
  create the peer-keepalive link
  the vPC peer-keepalive link, recommend that you associate a peer-keepalive link to a separate virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) instance that is mapped to a Layer 3 interface in each vPC peer deviceNo data or synchronization traffic moves over the vPC peer-keepalive link
  the vPC Peer-Link,
  All of the port channels in the vPC domain connected to the downstream device. 
  associate the vPC peer-keepalive link to a separate VRF mapped to a Layer 3 interface in each vPC peer device.
  Ensure that both the source and destination IP addresses used for the peer-keepalive messages are unique in your network and these IP addresses are reachable from the VRF associated with the vPC peer-keepalive link.
  Peer-keepalive IP addresses must be global unicast addresses
  You can have only one vPC domain ID on each device.

show hardware feature-capability (shows compatibility of hardware/software and commands on device)
Cisco Nexus 9500 switches
  configure the vPC Peer-Links on dedicated ports of different modules
  configure the vPC Peer-Link Layer 2 port channels as trunks using 2 or more Ethernet ports (Higher then 1-Gigabit)

Features That You Must Manually Configure on the Primary and Secondary Devices
  STP root
    Configure the primary vPC peer device as the STP primary root device 
    configure the vPC secondary device to be the STP secondary root device.
  Bridge Assurance
    configure the vPC Peer-Link interfaces as STP network ports so that Bridge Assurance is enabled on all vPC Peer-Links
  PVST+ & MST
    configure Rapid per VLAN Spanning Tree plus (PVST+) so that the primary device is the root for all VLANs
    configure Multiple Spanning Tree (MST) so that the primary device is the root for all instances.
  Layer 3 VLAN network interface
    Configure Layer 3 connectivity from each vPC peer device by configuring a VLAN network interface for the same VLAN from both devices.
  HSRP
    configure the primary vPC peer device with the HSRP active highest priority
    configure the secondary device to be the HSRP standby
    ensure that you have VLAN interfaces on each vPC device that are in the same administrative and operational mode
  LACP  
    If LACP is used as port-channel aggregation protocol, UDLD is not required in a vPC domain
